# Test - Databalk
### Overall
- I installed Node Js (to fet npm), and VS code to code
- Ater installing node I created the app by running ``` npx create-react-app foder_name ```
- For the resources I used 'psdetch'(since my laptop could not install XD due to the space and the graphics) to get the images, colors and fonts as well as the approximate measures and paddings
- I created modules (navbar, card items and hero section)
- For the grid I used Bootstrap 5, which helped with speeding the development process
- Afterwards I created the custom styles based on the modules 

To run the program, just type on the terminal ``` npm start ``` and access the page on 
```
http://localhost:3000/
